# Introduction

Gum is an open-source, general purpose UI tool.  While it has been developed primarily for creating video game UI, it can be used in any context given its open XML file format and plugin system.

Gum is written using C#, Windows Forms (aka winforms), and XNA.  It uses Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) to support a plugin system allowing customization without adding project-specific code to the core repository.
