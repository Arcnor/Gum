## Introduction

Gum is an open source project so you can run it from source instead of running the pre-compiled project.

## Obtaining the source code

# If you want to download the source:
## Download the source file from the "Source Code" link
## Unzip the file
# Otherwise if you want to run from the repository:
## Check the project out locally using TFS or SVN from CodePlex

## Running the code

# Locate the .sln file in the unzipped location
# Double-click it to open Visual Studio, or open Visual Studio and load the .sln
# Run the build configuration in "x86".  The build configuration may default to "Mixed Platforms". If you do not change it Gum will not compile.
